This is the repository where this project is going to be developed.

The project is based on the study and prediction of vehicles loan on Madrid Urban Roads using historical traffic intensity data that Madrid City Council provides on its [website](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=33cb30c367e78410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD).
